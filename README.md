# Citizen Labs Website

**Slack:** #cl-website

**Project Description:**
Citizen Labs website.

We are using [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/), an open source static site generator written in Go. Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Hugo provides improved performance, security and ease of use.

Updates to the beta site will take place after significant development changes.

**Ongoing Development:**

To address issues and functionality that have come up over time regarding the current website we have begun development on the `fresh-design` branch.

**Up and Running:**
* Hey thanks for stopping by, first you will need to install the Hugo CLI. If you are using MacOS you can use: `brew install hugo`
* Next clone in the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/homepage.git`
* `cd` into the directory.
* Fetch the theme submodule: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Running `hugo` will compile the site into a web ready viewable format.
* For local dev run `hugo server` to have live reload while working on it.
* By default we have it running on `http://localhost:1313/` copy this into your browser URL to see all the amazing changes you make.

Nice you rockstar! You've got it all set up.

**Production**
* Production build for our website is being done by Travis.
* After change, create Pull Request instead of building site locally and uploading.
* Once Pull Request is committed Travis will create the build and update website.
