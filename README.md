# Citizen Labs Website Redesign

**Up and Running:**
* Hey thanks for stopping by, first you will need to install the Hugo CLI. If you are using MacOS you can use: `brew install hugo`
* Next clone in the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/homepage.git`
* `cd` ino the directory.
* Running `hugo` will compile the site into a web ready viewable format.
* For local dev run `hugo server` to have live reload while working on it.
* By default we have it running on `http://localhost:1313/` copy this into your browser URL to see all the amazing changes you make.
* When ready to production (e.g. to have Google Analytics show up), run `HUGO_ENV=production` before your build command. For example: 
```
HUGO_ENV=production hugo
```
Nice you rockstar! You've got it all set up.

**Production**
* Production build for our website is being done by Travis.
* After change, create Pull Request instead of building site locally and uploading.
* Once Pull Request is committed Travis will create the build and update website.

**Project Description:**
Redesign of the Citizen Labs website.

We are using [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/), an open source static site generator written in Go. Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Hugo provides improved performance, security and ease of use.

Updates to the beta site will take place after significant development changes.
