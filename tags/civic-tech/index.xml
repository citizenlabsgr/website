      <description>2017 was an exciting year for Citizen Labs. We grew as an organization, spending a great deal of energy in creating a strong foundation that can deliver on our mission.
We have set bold goals to deliver on our mission.
Citizen Labs works together with our entire community to promote transparency, better understand problems, and support informed decisions. And to be purposeful in choosing the opportunities that may cross our path.</description>
