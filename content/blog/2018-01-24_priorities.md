2017 was an exciting year for Citizen Labs. We grew as an organization, spending a great deal of energy in creating a strong foundation that can deliver on our mission.

We have set bold goals to deliver on our mission.

## Delivering Impact, Not Code

At our core we believe engaged citizens can improve their communities. We are developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.
