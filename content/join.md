We build open source projects using public data to help improve civic engagement in our communities. Join us to learn what we're working on and how you can help!

We gather to share successes, seek support, and work on individual and group projects. Citizen Labs has a [Code of Conduct](/about/conduct/) that applies to all of our activities, events, and digital forums. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind.
