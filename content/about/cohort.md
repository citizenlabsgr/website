Community, technology, and empowerment are things that we strongly believe in. We also hope to make the biggest positive impact that we can.

<br>

While most of our work involves open data and open source software there are other organizations whose missions are consistent with ours and their work is complimentary to ours.

<br>


We have created the Citizen Labs Cohort as a way to leverage our 501c3 status to support formal and informal groups with their work. Our Cohorts retain their identity and run their own programs, while enjoying cross promotion, legal recognition, and 501c3 nonprofit status.

<br>

Our current and past Cohort includes:
