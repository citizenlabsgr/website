Citizen Labs works together with our entire community to promote transparency, better understand problems, and support informed decisions. We apply open data and open source technology, convene civic volunteers, and engage community leadership to create data-driven solutions.

Our volunteer community runs and drives all Citizen Labs projects! We highly encourage all to become involved and contribute. We believe from our neighborhoods to our cities there's always more room for improvement.

Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!

## We are Open

**open organization:** Instead of bosses, we have [guides](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/read-first/blob/master/guide-role-description.md) and [ambassadors](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/read-first/blob/master/project-ambassador.md). Conversations take place on [Slack instead](https://join.slack.com/t/citizenlabs/shared_invite/enQtNTQ0Mjk1NjQ3NjcxLTBhMDcwNGU2NDExMzFiNWUyYjUxZjFkZTY5ODc4NTg1ZGNkNTJkYmIxNGUxNjA4NmMzM2VlYjBjZTI1NWRjMTQ) of email so that everyone can follow along. We also put a priority on documentation, for this we use [Github](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr). On Github we document our projects, [how we work](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/read-first), along with our [bylaws and board minutes](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/community).

**open source:** We develop solutions that are open to other cities and communities to use. In turn we will often use other's open source project to jump start our work. Using open source technology allows us to stand on the shoulders of others, deploying proven solutions faster and cheaper.
