Citizen Labs builds open source tools powered by public data to strengthen civic engagement in our communities.

<br>

Our volunteer community runs and drives all Citizen Labs projects! We highly encourage all to become involved and contribute. We believe from our neighborhoods to our cities there's always more room for improvement.

<br>

Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!
